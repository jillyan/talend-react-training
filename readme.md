This is for talend react training.
We will create a react project based on talend cmf.

You could install dependencies for this project by:
```
npm install
```

You could run current projct by 

```
npm start
```

I prepared several steps in this toturial. Please follow lessons/stepX.

You could also create your own cmf project by using command:
```
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-talend
yo talend:react-cmf
```

`npm install -g yo` is to install yeoman.
`npm install -g generator-talend` is to install talend generator.
`yo talend:react-cmf` is to generate your own react-cmf project.
